Unlike more naive imitation learning methods, ACT predicts action sequences multiple timesteps into the future (coined \"action chunks\") at each inference step, with the aim of reducing the effective horizon of a task and thus mitigating compounding error. Furthermore, action chunks are aggregated across multiple inference steps through \"temporal ensembling\" to smooth out potential discontinuities in the predicted action sequences. Details on the ACT algorithm can be found in the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13705).\n",
